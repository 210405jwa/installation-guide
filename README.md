# ROC Environment Setup Guide
---

## Purpose

> This document provides a list of the required technologies for anyone who will be participating in the ROC program. It details why each technology is required and provides some step-by-step instructions on how to install and configure the technologies. This guide also walks you through any needed environment setup.

**NOTE**: It is VERY important that you install these technologies before training begins as we will not have much time to devote to environment setup due to the volume of content we'll cover. It is also important that you install the correct versions of the tools listed here as not all versions of the technologies we will use are guaranteed to be compatible with each other. If you choose to use a different version of one of the tools listed here, you will be responsible for debugging issues that are specific to your version.

## Required Technologies

The following technologies are required in order to complete this phase of the program:

- **Git**: We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.
- **Java SE Development Kit 8**: We will be utilizing Java 8 as our primary language for the duration of the program. This software development kit will provide the compiler and runtime environment needed to quickly and efficiently develop Java applications. Please uninstall any other Java versions if it is there in your machine please as it would cause trouble later.
- **Spring Tool Suite 4**: We will be using Spring Tool Suite 4 as our *integrated development environment* (IDE). Though you don't need an IDE to write code, an IDE provides several features that make rapid development (e.g. quickly writing and refactoring code) easier.
- **Apache Maven**: Maven is a software project management and build automation tool. We will use it to manage our projects' builds as it provides dependency management and streamlines several aspects of the testing life cycle.
- **MariaDB**: MariaDB is an open source relational database. We will leverage this technology in order to persist and organize data.
- **DBeaver**: DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data sources, MariaDB included. We'll use DBeaver in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user interface provided to us by the tool.
- **Postman**: Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. We'll use it to set up collections of tests for the RESTful APIs we design throughout the program. It can also be used to quickly test a single endpoint.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Visual Studio Code is a text editor that makes viewing and modifying code simple. Do not confuse this tool with an integrated development environment as it does not come equipped with all of the development tools you typically find in an IDE.


**NOTE**: This guide primarily is written for those on a Windows Machine. For Mac users [this guide](https://github.com/KodaZys/mac-install-guide) may be more helpful. **A major difference between the linked Mac installation guide and this one is that you should install MariaDB instead of Postgres**. This may require some research on your end.


## Installation Steps

This method is compatible with all environments as it does not require any platform-specific package managers. You need only visit the official websites for each of the technologies listed and download the version of the tool that is compatible with your system.

Do note, however, that setting system environment variables differs from machine to machine. This guide shows how to set environment variables on a Windows machine.

The first thing you'll want to do is open your web browser of choice. This guide will use *Chrome*.

**Note**: Many of the tools that you will install have different system installers that are platform dependent. It is **very** important that you download the correct installer. The following list details how you should choose the installer for a program:

- If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 32-bit version.
- If you have a 64-bit version of Windows, use the installer that is marked as the 64-bit version.
- If you have a Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora), you should choose the installer that matches your distribution.
- If you have a Mac, you should choose the installer that is marked as the Mac installer.

These options will be clearly labeled on the websites you visit to download the technologies. If you're not sure how to figure out what version of the Windows operating system you're running, do the following:

1. Type "Control Panel" into the Windows search bar and click on the "Control Panel" app.
2. Select "System and Security".
3. Select "System".

You should now see the following screen:

![Image of Windows System Settings](./images/windows-system.PNG)

You should see your operating system listed ("Windows 10" in the above example) and the system type listed under the "System" tab (a 64-bit operating system in the above example).

### Step 1: Install Git

1. Navigate in your browser to [Git's Website](https://git-scm.com/download) and click the latest download for Windows. (For those using a different OS click the appropriate OS and look for the most recent stable release.)

### Step 5: Install MariaDB

In order to install MariaDB, please visit [MariaDB's official website](https://mariadb.org/download).

Once you've navigated to the website, you should see the following:

![MariaDB Download Home](./images/mariadb-download.PNG)

Select the latest version of MariaDB, choose the correct operating system, and select x86_64 if you are on a 64-bit machine, or x86 if you are on a 32-bit machine.

Click download, which should start the download process. Wait for the download to complete.

The file should now be located in your "Downloads" folder.

![MariaDB In Downloads Folder](./images/mariadb-in-downloads.PNG)

Double click the file, which should launch the installer. You might be asked if you want the application to make changes to your device. Say "yes".

You'll be presented with several menus in the Setup Wizard.

![MariaDB Setup Wizard](./images/mariadb-setup.PNG)

Continue to hit "Next", accepting the terms in the License Agreement, etc. until you reach the "Default instance properties" menu. Here you will be tasked with providing a password for the default MariaDB user (which is "root"). The password is completely up to you. That said, DO NOT forget your password as you won't be able to login to your database as the superuser. If you have to, write your password down somewhere or use a password manager.

![MariaDB Password](./images/mariadb-password.PNG)

After you've decided on a password, hit "Next", which should bring you to the next set of properties. Click "Next", which should take you to the option to install.

<code>**NOTE:** If you get a message such as "The TCP Port you selected is already in use. Please choose a different port", this is because you likely already have a SQL server installed on your machine that is using that particular port, such as MySQL. In that case, either uninstall that other SQL database, or set the "TCP port" option to another port such as 3307 instead of the default 3306.</code>

![MariaDB Port](./images/mariadb-port.PNG)

MariaDB should now be successfully installed on your computer.

### Step 6: Install DBeaver

In order to install DBeaver, please visit [DBeaver's official website](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
